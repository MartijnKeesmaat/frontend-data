# ðŸ“ˆ NVWM Dashboard
> Uitstekende documentatie, ik heb hier niets meer aan toe te voegen, veel succes morgen! [@roberrrt-s](https://github.com/MartijnKeesmaat/functional-programming/issues/24)

The NVWM Dashboard is a project created for the [functional programming](https://github.com/cmda-tt/course-19-20/tree/master/functional-programming) of the [Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hva.nl/)

In functional programming (fp) you learn how to create visualisations from external data, and how to clean and transform data, use svg, use d3, and specifically use d3â€™s scales. You additionally apply learning attained in frontend apps.

For this project I created a dashboard which first shows the main categories of the [NMVW organisation](https://collectie.wereldculturen.nl/#/query/a399dc40-72c2-48e0-9675-654ffc84570f) and second the materials of their respective category. The categories are displayed in a bar chart. This chart shows 5 categories. If the user scrolls he/she can view all categories. The user will be greeted with the materials of a category when clicked on a bar in the bar chart.

## Demo
See the the live demo [here](https://functional-progammer.netlify.com/)

> disclaimer, the demo is still static, hence it doesn't show the categories dynamically

## Install
First install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

To create a production build:

```sh
npm run build-prod
```

To create a development build:

```sh
npm run build-dev
```

## Wiki
The [wiki](https://github.com/MartijnKeesmaat/functional-programming/wiki) documents the progress of this project. It goes over the process through the stages of the concept, technical research, visual design and prototype.

## Data
The data that is used comes from the database of the [NMVW collection](https://collectie.wereldculturen.nl/). For the assignment we are asked to use [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/) to retrieve the data. 

Data being used in the app regards the main categories and their respective most-used materials. The process of gaining this data is explained on the [quest for the query](https://github.com/MartijnKeesmaat/functional-programming/wiki/Quest-for-the-query) page.

### Data cleaning
Since the data that is being retrieved doesn't need much cleaning, I decided to clean the survey data from another project. This is explained on the [data cleaning](https://github.com/MartijnKeesmaat/functional-programming/wiki/Data-cleaning-exercise) page.
